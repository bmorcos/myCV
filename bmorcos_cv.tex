\section{ABOUT ME}

\vspace{-5pt}
My BASc. in Mechatronics Engineering has given me a broad foundation of skills which allowed me to explore a variety of fields. However, my latest position developing hardware in the context of neuroscience has me especially engaged and excited. Furthermore, working with a plethora of leading PhD. scientists allows me to learn everyday and motivated me to continue my educations and pursue a master's degree.
