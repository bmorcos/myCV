\section{ABOUT ME}

My academic and work experience has given me skills and knowledge at many levels
of abstraction. I have worked on gate-level hardware, embedded software,
distributed cloud backends, frontend clients, and everything in between! This
breadth of experience led me to the label \emph{full(er) stack developer} and it
lends me perspective when designing systems or working in multidisciplinary
teams. I am always looking for new challenges to hone my skills.
